          Hi, I'm Honey Deshmukh, an enthusiastic frontend developer from Surat. I'm
          currently in my second year studying Bsc.it from vidhyadeep university.
          Over the past 1 years, I've immersed myself in web development,
          gaining solid proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I'm
          committed to continuous learning and development, and I'm excited to
          apply my skills to new opportunities in the future.
        </p>
